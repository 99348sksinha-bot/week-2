I have developed and trained a Crop Yield Prediction Model that uses machine learning techniques to forecast the expected yield of different crops. The model takes into account key factors such as soil nutrients, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and pH value to provide accurate predictions.

During the development process, the dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the data for training. Multiple algorithms were tested, and the best-performing one was selected based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

The trained model can now predict crop yield effectively, helping farmers and agricultural planners make better decisions regarding crop selection and resource management. This will ultimately support improved productivity and sustainable farming practices
